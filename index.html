        <h2>Letter from the founder</h2>
        <p>The cryptocurrency media landscape has yet to mature. As of now, most of the information being published is
            severely biased and is intended to serve the needs of the publisher rather than the reader.</p>
        
        <p>Over time, the journalistic integrity within the cryptocurrency community will improve. However, if you’re an
            early investor in cryptocurrencies, you need good information now.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>The need for quality information is why we’re creating Coin Canary.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Let’s say you’ve heard of a new cryptocurrency and you want to research whether or not it’s a good
            investment. Who do you trust to provide an unbiased opinion?
        </p>
        
        <p>Coin Canary works by analyzing articles published about a cryptocurrency over time. With this information,
            you can view how the news affects the price and how the price affects the news. This provides you with an
            unbiased perspective of a cryptocurrency’s media landscape.
        </p>
        
        <p>In addition, we’re tracking social media mentions per cryptocurrency, which gives you the ability to track a
            coin’s following over time. By correlating price with social media mentions, we can judge the strength of a
            cryptocurrency’s organic growth rate.
        </p>
        
        <p>A few use cases are outlined above but there will be much more we can do with this data, and we intend to
            deploy new features quickly. First, however, we’re focused on developing the beta product and getting
            feedback from users.
        </p>
        
        <p>If you’re interested in using the beta version (planned for March 2018), make sure to sign up for the
            waitlist. We’ll be recruiting beta users from this list.
        </p>
